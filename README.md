# Quantifying the Effect of Social Presence on Online Social Conformity

This study investigates how the perceived social presence facilitated in an online group setting impacts online conformity behaviour. We manipulate social presence via interactivity (discussion vs. no discussion), response visibility (public vs. private answers) and user representation (generic vs. user-specific avatars). <br/>

I created a simple web application to simulate an online quiz, where our participants answered a set of objective and subjective multiple-choice questions.
The quiz was followed by a big-five questionnaire (which captured their personality traits).<br/>

We used a <b>“Confederates’ App”</b> to simulate a discussion among four fake participants in <b>discussion</b> experimental conditions (to create a group of five, including the real participant). <br/> 
For more information on this experiment, please refer to our paper at https://www.senuriwijenayake.com/papers/2020/CSCW20.pdf <br/>

## Setting up the web application and server

<b>Note: The “Confederates’ App” is only necessary in the <i>discussion</i> experimental conditions. If you plan to test the application without disucssion, simply setting up the server and the web application is sufficient.</b><br/>

Step 1: Download this repository which includes the server code. <br/>
Step 2: Run "npm install" using a Command Line Interface (CLI) to install all packages required for the server to run. <br/>
Step 3: Run "node app.js" on the CLI to start the server. <br/>
Step 4: Download the web application code at https://github.com/SenuriWijenayake/Social-Conformity-S3-app. <br/>
Step 4: Open the "index.html" page of the web application to start the quiz.<br/>
Step 5 (optional): To set up the <b>“Confederates’ App”</b>, access the code at https://github.com/SenuriWijenayake/Social-Conformity-S3-confederates-app.<br/>
